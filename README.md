# TransferableEduProjects

Our experience is, that unfortunately many student projects go by the end of the semester in the trashbin.
We think that students working on long running projects (for a few years) and projects that solve real issues, have a much richer learning experience that is as close to real practice as can be in an educational setting.

When we started this journey end 2019 we encountered many hurdles and unanswered questions, for which we found possible solutions. Still, not everything is answered. We learn each semester, and make changes or add solutions to our way of working.

We try to get inspiration from real life examples like for example experiences from open source community, other institutes, discussion with peers, etcetera

This public github has been created with the intention to make our processes and ideas visible to the community. Helping those who want to start en asking those with experience to contribute to the ideas.

At this moment the project consists of:
* Wiki, that captures the knowledge we built up with these type of student projects
* Work procedures, describing practical examples on how to set-up development environment that help in easy transfer of projects.
