# ContinuousEduProjects

Many student projects dissapear by the end of the semester in the trashbin. This finite lifetime seems to have an effect on fun, experiencing the real need, and transferabillity. 
We think that by letting students working on long running projects (for a few years) that are meaningfull (solving an issue for a real customer), provide a much richer learning experience, and brings an experience that is very close to real practice.

When we started this journey end 2019 we encountered many hurdles and unanswered questions, for which we found possible solutions. Still, many questions still reamin. We learn each semester, and make changes or add solutions to our way of working.

We try to get inspiration from real life examples like for example experiences from open source community, other institutes, discussion with peers, etcetera

This public github has been created with the intention to make our processes and ideas visible to the community. Helping those who want to start en asking those with experience to contribute to the ideas.

At this moment the project consists of:
* <a href="https://github.com/patrickdb/TransferableEduProjects/wiki">Wiki</a>, here we capture the knowledge and challenges on how to set-up, guide and assist in long term student projects. 
* Work procedures, practical guidelines on how to set-up development environment that help in easy transfer of projects.
* <a href="https://github.com/patrickdb/TransferableEduProjects/issues">Issues</a>. Challenges we currently see and we would like to see picked up in the near future.

Feel free to contribute.
